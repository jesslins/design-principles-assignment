      <div id="important-info">
        <h3 class="heading">Land Acknowledgement</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, there is a land acknowledgement that is said at the beginning
          of most events taking place on Treaty 1 land to recognize that we (the
          people attending the event and/or living on this land) are currently on
          Treaty 1 territory. This is what the land acknowledgement says:
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 20px">
          "We acknowledge we are gathered on Treaty 1 Territory and that Manitoba is located on the Treaty Territories
          and
          ancestral lands of the Anishinaabeg, Anishininewuk, Dakota Oyate, Denesuline and Nehethowuk Nations.
          <br />
          We acknowledge Manitoba is located on the Homeland of the Red River Métis.
          <br />
          We acknowledge northern Manitoba includes lands that were and are the ancestral lands of the Inuit.
          <br />
          We respect the spirit and intent of Treaties and Treaty Making and remain committed to working in partnership
          with First Nations, Inuit and Métis people in the spirit of truth, reconciliation and collaboration."

      <h3 class="heading">Naawi-Oodena</h3>
      <p>
        Naawi-Oodena is an urban reserve that is currently being developed in Winnipeg. Here is a quote from
        Canada Lands Company:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Redevelopment of Naawi-Oodena took a significant step forward in 2019 when the federal government and the T1N
        signed a Comprehensive Settlement Agreement (CSA). The agreement outlines the land division, allocating 32 per
        cent to Canada Lands and the remaining 68 per cent to the establishment of an Urban Reserve held in common by
        the seven T1N ...
        <br />
        In March 2021, after nearly two years of joint planning and public engagement, the T1N and Canada Lands Company
        released their master plan for the 65-hectare (160-acre) site. The plan details all aspects of the development
        ranging from green space and recreation facilities to a variety of housing, retail and commercial options. At
        full completion, the redevelopment of Naawi-Oodena could accommodate between 2,300 and 3,000 homes, and 915,000
        to 1.2 million square feet of commercial space.
        <br />
        This landmark development will represent the largest multi-use project in modern Winnipeg history and the single
        largest, strategically located urban Indigenous economic zone in Canada."

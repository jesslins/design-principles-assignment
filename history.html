      <p>
        The negotiations for Treaty 1 started on the 27th of July, 1871. The
        First Nations were told, "Your Great Mother, therefore, will lay aside
        for you 'lots' of land to be used by you and your children forever. She
        will not allow the white men to intrude upon these lots. She will make
        rules to keep them for you, so that as long as the sun shall shine,
        there shall be no Indian who has not a place that he can call his home."
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the negotiations for this treaty, there was a constant
        difficulty to form a mutual understanding of concepts that were unknown
        to the First Nations, such as "reserves" and "surrender". Treaty 1 was
        officially signed on the 3rd of August, 1871.
